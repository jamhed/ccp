## Research and Statistics

### TDD Effectiveness
- Microsoft/IBM study showing 40-90% reduction in pre-release defect density
- 15-30% increase in initial development time with TDD
- 40% decrease in defect rates for TDD-adopting organizations

### Testing Pyramid Distribution
- Recommended distribution: 50% unit, 30% integration, 20% E2E (modern adjustments)
- Traditional distribution: 70% unit, 20% integration, 10% E2E

### pytest Adoption
- 40% of developers report enhanced readability and reusability with pytest
- Usage of pytest-asyncio surged 30% for non-blocking I/O applications

### Containerization
- 55% of organizations use Docker for consistent test environments
- 50% reduction in integration bugs with containerization
