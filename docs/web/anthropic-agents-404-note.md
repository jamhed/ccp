# Agents Documentation - Not Available

## Status

The requested URL at `/en/docs/agents` could not be found on the docs.claude.com server (404 error).

## Alternative Resources

The documentation site offers comprehensive guides on building with Claude, including sections that may contain agent-related information:

- **Agent Skills Overview** - Available in capabilities/tools sections
- **Agent SDK Documentation** - May be found in developer guide
- **Tool Use and Implementation** - See `/en/docs/build-with-claude/tool-use`
- **Model Context Protocol (MCP)** - MCP connectors and agent frameworks

## Recommendation

To find agent-related documentation, navigate through:
1. The main Developer Guide section
2. API Reference for programmatic agent building
3. Tool Use documentation for agent capabilities
4. Claude Code documentation for CLI-based agent workflows

## Alternative Approaches

Since the dedicated agents page doesn't exist, consider:
1. Searching for "building agents with Claude" on the main docs site
2. Reviewing the prompt engineering guide for agent-specific patterns
3. Exploring MCP documentation for agent orchestration patterns
4. Checking the resources section for agent examples and tutorials

## Note

This indicates that Anthropic may not have a single dedicated "agents" documentation page, but instead distributes agent-related content across tool use, prompt engineering, and MCP documentation sections.
