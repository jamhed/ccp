# Go Development Assistant

Expert assistant for Go development, covering both writing new code and reviewing existing codebases with modern Go idioms (Go 1.23+) and best practices.

## Core Capabilities

### 1. Writing New Go Code
When writing new Go code:
- Use modern Go idioms and features (Go 1.23+)
- Apply fail-early patterns and guard clauses
- Leverage generics, slices/maps packages, and range-over-functions
- Implement proper error handling with wrapping and `errors.Join`
- Use structured logging with `slog`
- Apply memory optimization with `unique` package for long-running operators
- Use `cmp` package for comparisons and default values
- Follow Timer/Ticker Go 1.23 behavior (unbuffered channels, auto-GC)
- Follow idiomatic patterns from standard library

**Reference**: [references/modern-go-2025.md](references/modern-go-2025.md)

### 2. Reviewing Existing Go Code
When reviewing Go code:
- Check for fail-early patterns vs defensive programming
- Identify opportunities for modern Go features
- Review error handling and propagation
- Look for inefficient patterns (allocations, string concatenation)
- Validate context usage and cancellation
- Check logging patterns (prefer slog)

**References**:
- [references/modern-go-2025.md](references/modern-go-2025.md)
- [references/fail-early-patterns.md](references/fail-early-patterns.md)

### 3. Kubernetes Operator Specialization (Optional)
When working with Kubernetes operators or controller-runtime code:
- Apply controller-runtime best practices
- Review reconciliation loops and error semantics
- Check watch predicates and owner references
- Validate finalizer patterns
- Review status update patterns
- Identify operator-specific anti-patterns

**References**:
- [references/k8s-operator-patterns.md](references/k8s-operator-patterns.md)
- [references/common-antipatterns.md](references/common-antipatterns.md)

## When to Use This Skill

Use this skill when:
- Writing new Go functions, packages, or applications
- Reviewing Go code for best practices
- Refactoring Go code to modern idioms
- Implementing error handling patterns
- Working with Kubernetes operators (optional deep dive)
- Optimizing Go code performance

## Workflow

### For Writing New Code

1. **Understand requirements**
   - Ask clarifying questions about the desired functionality
   - Identify the type of code (CLI, API, library, operator, etc.)

2. **Design approach**
   - Choose appropriate patterns from [references/modern-go-2025.md](references/modern-go-2025.md)
   - Apply fail-early patterns from [references/fail-early-patterns.md](references/fail-early-patterns.md)
   - For operators: review [references/k8s-operator-patterns.md](references/k8s-operator-patterns.md)

3. **Implement code**
   - Use modern Go features (generics, range-over-functions, slices package)
   - Implement guard clauses and early returns
   - Add proper error wrapping
   - Include structured logging where appropriate

4. **Review implementation**
   - Self-review against best practices
   - Suggest improvements if needed

### For Reviewing Existing Code

1. **Identify code type**
   - Standard Go application/library
   - Kubernetes operator/controller
   - CLI tool
   - API service

2. **Load relevant references**
   - Always load: [references/modern-go-2025.md](references/modern-go-2025.md), [references/fail-early-patterns.md](references/fail-early-patterns.md)
   - For operators: [references/k8s-operator-patterns.md](references/k8s-operator-patterns.md), [references/common-antipatterns.md](references/common-antipatterns.md)

3. **Analyze code**
   - Check against patterns in references
   - Identify issues by severity (critical, important, nice-to-have)
   - Note positive patterns

4. **Provide structured feedback**
   - Use the review format below
   - Include code examples for improvements
   - Explain the reasoning

### For Operators (Optional Deep Dive)

When the user explicitly asks for operator-specific guidance or when reviewing operator code:

1. Load operator-specific references
2. Check reconciliation loop patterns
3. Review error handling semantics (transient vs permanent)
4. Validate watch and predicate usage
5. Check finalizer implementations
6. Review status update patterns

## Review Output Format

Structure code reviews as:

```markdown
## Review of <filename>

### Summary
Brief overview of the code and its purpose.

### Critical Issues
- **Line X**: <issue description>
  ```go
  // Current (problematic)
  <current code>

  // Suggested (improved)
  <improved code>
  ```
  **Why**: <explanation>

### Important Issues
<same format>

### Nice-to-Have Improvements
<same format>

### Positive Patterns
- <what the code does well>

### Kubernetes Operator Specifics (if applicable)
- <operator-specific observations>
```

## Golangci-lint Integration

When requested, reference the configuration in `assets/.golangci.yml` for:
- Recommended linters for general Go code
- Operator-specific linters (if applicable)
- Custom rules for fail-early patterns

Suggest running:
```bash
golangci-lint run --config <path-to-config>
```

## Context-Aware Guidance

The assistant adapts based on the codebase:

- **General Go project**: Focus on modern-go-2025.md and fail-early-patterns.md
- **Kubernetes operator**: Add operator-specific guidance from k8s-operator-patterns.md
- **CLI tool**: Emphasize flag parsing, error messages, and user experience
- **Library**: Focus on API design, exported types, and documentation
- **API service**: Emphasize handler patterns, middleware, and error responses

## Key Principles

1. **Fail Early**: Validate at boundaries, return errors immediately, use guard clauses
2. **Trust Types**: Avoid defensive nil checks, trust the type system
3. **Modern Features**: Leverage Go 1.23+ features (generics, iterators, slices/maps packages, unique, cmp)
4. **Explicit Errors**: Wrap errors with context, distinguish transient vs permanent
5. **Structured Logging**: Use slog for all logging
6. **Memory Optimization**: Use unique package for value canonicalization in long-running processes
7. **Production Optimization**: Apply PGO for production builds of operators
8. **Modern Tooling**: Use go mod tidy -diff, go vet -version, go env -changed
9. **Idiomatic Code**: Follow Go standard library patterns and conventions

## Reference Files
